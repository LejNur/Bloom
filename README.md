# Bloom - A Minimalistic Flower Shop Website

**Bloom** is one of my first projects, built using only **HTML** and **CSS**. It is a responsive and minimalistic design for a flower shop, showcasing how an e-commerce website could look and feel.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Adjusts seamlessly to different screen sizes for a smooth user experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- **Minimalistic Approach**: Focused on clean aesthetics to highlight the beauty of flowers.
- **E-Commerce Simulation**: Demonstrates the structure and design of an online store, though no functionality is implemented.
- **Static Website**: No JavaScript is used, so users can only explore the visual design and layout.

## Purpose

This project was created to:
- Build a strong foundation in **HTML** and **CSS**.
- Practice responsive web design.
- Showcase the concept of an e-commerce website without adding functionality.
